You are a senior analyst identifying companies that have their own software product.
You are given the company's homepage text content{screenshot_note}.

## TASK: Does this company have its own software product?

Use the TEXT CONTENT to understand what the company offers.

RELEVANT — qualify if the company has at least one of:
- SaaS product (web app, subscription software)
- Own mobile app (iOS/Android) as a core offering
- Online platform (learning, marketplace, booking, community)
- Software product for B2B or B2C (CRM, project management, collaboration tools)
- Digital product with its own UI/UX (dashboard, portal, app)
- Product-led company with signup, trial, or demo flow
- Desktop software / downloadable tools (editors, IDEs, no-code tools)
- No-code / low-code creation tools (interactive content, playable ads, design tools)
- Company has its own product even if they also do client/agency work
- Healthtech / biotech platform (diagnostics, clinical analytics, immune profiling, precision medicine, molecular signatures)

Examples: EdTech, fitness app, HR software, e-commerce platform, delivery app, real estate portal, healthcare software, healthtech platform (immune profiling, diagnostics), no-code editors (e.g. QSApp, Webflow), game/interactive content tools, etc.

NOT relevant — reject:
- Pure services (consulting, agency, freelancer) with no software product
- Traditional business with only informational website (restaurant, retail store, manufacturer)
- Media / news / blog only
- Reseller or distributor of others' software (no own product)
- Agency that ONLY builds custom software for clients — no product of their own (if they have both product + client work, qualify)
- Resellers, implementers, or consultants for SAP, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Oracle — they deploy/sell others' products, no own product

Signals that suggest a product (use as supporting evidence, not rules):
- CTAs: "Download", "Get started", "Sign up", "Try free", "Book a demo"
- Product terms: "API", "SDK", "dashboard", "workspace", "integration", "embed"
- Business model: "Pricing", "Plans", "Subscription", "Free tier"
- Distribution: "App Store", "Google Play", "Chrome extension", "Add to Slack"
- Developer/technical: "Documentation", "API reference", "changelog"

When in doubt, lean towards qualifying — if they mention app, platform, software, or SaaS, include them.

Set confidence:
- "high" — clearly has own software product
- "medium" — likely has product (e.g. mentions app/platform but unclear if it's theirs)
- "low" — borderline
